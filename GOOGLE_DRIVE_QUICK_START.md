## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Where are the files stored?**  
A: In Google Drive, accessible via the service account. If you configure a parent folder, all exports go there.

**Q: Can I edit the spreadsheet?**  
A: Yes! The file is automatically shared with your instructor email with Editor access.

**Q: What if I export multiple times?**  
A: The system reuses the existing file with the same name, so you won't get duplicates.

**Q: Can students see the exported grades?**  
A: No, only the instructor's email is granted access to the spreadsheet.

**Q: What happens if Drive storage is full?**  
A: The system falls back to adding a new tab in the hub spreadsheet instead of creating a new file.

**Q: How do I organize old class records?**  
A: Create folders in Google Drive and move older files to archive folders manually.
