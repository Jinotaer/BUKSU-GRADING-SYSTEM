# Google Sheets Export - Troubleshooting Guide

## üî¥ Current Issue: Permission Error

**Error**: `500 Internal Server Error` when clicking "Export to Google Sheets"

**Root Cause**: Service account doesn't have permission to access the hub spreadsheet.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (Choose One Option)

### Option 1: Share Hub Spreadsheet with Service Account (Recommended)

This allows the system to use the fallback hub spreadsheet when needed.

**Steps**:

1. **Open the Hub Spreadsheet**
   - Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DDKXYakqgSDGSTwG1-T3ey6EmIF9X_gv3IN6i4p3C7g/edit
   
2. **Click "Share" Button** (top-right corner)

3. **Add Service Account Email**
   - Enter: `bgs-812@grading-system-472908.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Set permission: **Editor**
   - **Uncheck** "Notify people" (it's a service account, not a person)
   
4. **Click "Share"**

5. **Restart Backend Server**
   ```powershell
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
   # Then start it again:
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Test Again**
   - Try exporting from the Grade Management page
   - Should work now! ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Remove Hub Spreadsheet (Alternative)

If you don't want to use a hub spreadsheet, you can remove it from the configuration.

**Steps**:

1. **Edit `.env` File**
   - Open: `backend/.env`
   - Find the line:
     ```env
     EXPORT_HUB_SPREADSHEET_ID=1DDKXYakqgSDGSTwG1-T3ey6EmIF9X_gv3IN6i4p3C7g
     ```
   - Change it to (leave it empty):
     ```env
     EXPORT_HUB_SPREADSHEET_ID=
     ```

2. **Save the File**

3. **Restart Backend Server**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test Again**
   - The system will create new spreadsheets instead of using a hub
   - Each section gets its own file

**Note**: This option means the system won't have a fallback if storage quota is exceeded.

## üîç Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Backend Logs

When you try to export, watch the backend server terminal for error messages. Look for:

```
‚ùå exportGradesToGoogleSheets error: [error details]
```

### Step 2: Check Browser Console

Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:
- Red errors in Console tab
- Network tab ‚Üí Look for the POST request to `/api/grade/export-sheets/`
- Response body may contain error details

### Step 3: Test API Directly

Use the test script to verify configuration:

```powershell
cd backend
node test-google-sheets.js
```

This will show exactly which component is failing.
