# BUKSU Grading System - Description and Key Features

## 1.3 Description

The BUKSU Grading System is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to simplify and secure academic grading and course management for Bukidnon State University stakeholders. This all-in-one solution helps administrators, instructors, and students by automating grade recording, activity scoring, section and schedule management, and report generation — all through an intuitive interface that reduces manual errors and saves administrative time.

The system enforces role-based access controls to protect data integrity and ensure each user has the appropriate privileges. Administrators can manage users, sections, semesters, subjects, and archive records; instructors can create and manage activities, submit activity scores, compute final grades using built-in grade calculation utilities, and generate class reports; students can view their enrolled sections, schedules, activity breakdowns, and official grade reports. The locking mechanism prevents concurrent edits to sensitive records, and audit logging preserves a traceable history of changes.

BUKSU Grading System integrates essential services to streamline workflows and communication. It supports export with Google Sheets for bulk data handling, calendar integration for schedule synchronization, and automated email notifications for grade releases and account actions. Optional AI-augmented utilities help with tasks like grade suggestions and data validation, while secure authentication, brute-force protection, HTTP hardening, and logging utilities help keep the system safe and auditable.

By consolidating grading tasks, activity management, and administrative workflows into a single, user-focused platform, the system improves accuracy, transparency, and responsiveness across the academic office and classroom. Automated calculations and exportable reports help instructors deliver timely feedback, while administrators retain centralized control and visibility — collectively producing a reliable, efficient grading ecosystem that keeps students and staff informed and up to date.
